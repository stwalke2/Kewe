# How We Work (Rules for Humans + Agents)

## Workflow
1. Every change starts with a GitHub Issue.
2. Spec/plan first. Code second.
3. Small PRs only (ideally < 500 lines).
4. Tests required for new domain rules and endpoints.
5. No secrets in repo (use env vars / local config).

## Planning Mode Requirement
Before implementing a feature, produce:
- Requirements + non-goals
- Proposed API + data model
- Test plan
- Risks / open questions

Only implement after the plan is approved.

## Tech Stack
- Java + Spring Boot
- MongoDB
- React later
